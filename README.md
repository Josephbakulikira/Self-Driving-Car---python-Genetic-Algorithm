### Bugs (Unsolved Issues)
For a much better ai of self driving car , you should try to get maybe four output for brake, accelerate, left and right 
instead of just left and right as i did. Although this might take a lot of time to train but it definetly the better way to do it.

   - The car control still need a little bit of work.
   - The AI only decide if it will go right or left, to get a much better ai should decide by itself when to accelerate , when to brake and so on
       if you have a time and find a solution you can make a pull request.

 If you want a track with a higher resolution and a higher control point , you can change this parameters in the constants file

 Also When you load your saved data try to check if the N_points and spline_resolution are the same with the variables of the saved tracks, 
 if they are not the same this might  cause the saved track to look weird , to solve that issue you just have to change the n_points and 
 spline resolution in the constants file to the value store the   SavedTrack["variables"], ... 
 if you have a time to solve that issue you can always make a pull request .
