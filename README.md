 If you want a track with a higher resolution and a higher control point , you can change this parameters in the constants file

 Also When you load your saved data try to check if the N_points and spline_resolution are the same with the variables of the saved tracks, 
 if they are not the same this might  cause the saved track to look weird , to solve that issue you just have to change the n_points and 
 spline resolution in the constants file to the value store the   SavedTrack["variables"], ... 
 if you have a time to solve that issue you can always make a pull request .

### Bugs
     The car control still need a little bit of work
